// Find the calculation type
// You have to create a function calcType, which receives 3 arguments: 2 numbers, and the result of an unknown operation performed on them (also a number).
// Based on those 3 values you have to return a string, that describes which operation was used to get the given result.
// The possible return strings are: "addition", "subtraction", "multiplication", "division".

const calcType = (a, b, res) => {
  if (a + b === res) {
    return 'addition';
  }
  if (a - b === res) {
    return 'subtraction';
  }
  if (a * b === res) {
    return 'multiplication';
  }
  if (a / b === res) {
    return 'division';
  }
}
