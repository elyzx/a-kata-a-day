// Leap Years
// In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not. In case you don't know the rules, here they are:
// - years divisible by 4 are leap years
// - but years divisible by 100 are not leap years
// - but years divisible by 400 are leap years

function isLeapYear(year) {
  if (year % 400 == 0) {
    return true;
  }
  if (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) {
    return true;
  }
  else {
    return false;
  }
};
